Tim Menzies (**IEEE Fellow**, Ph.D., UNSW, 1995) is a **full Professor** in CS at North Carolina State
where he explores how SE can improve optimization, ethics, and explainable AI.
He is the director of the RAISE lab (real world AI for SE) and the author of over **280 publications**
 (refereed) with 20,000+ citations and an h-index of 69.  
He has graduated **20 Ph.D. students**, and has been a 
lead researcher on projects for NSF, NIJ, DoD, NASA, USDA (total funding of 
**$13+ million**) as well as joint research work with private companies. Prof. Menzies is the 
**editor-in-chief** of the Automated Software Engineering journal and 
**associate editor of TSE**  (IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering) and other leading SE journals.
